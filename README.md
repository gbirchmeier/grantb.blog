===========

Just using bundler for now.


Testing

Just `rake test` and `rake cucumber` for now


Shitty platform issues

**Bundler**
Bundler 1.5.0 was installed by default, but it was being stupid,
so I installed 1.6.6.

* gem install bundler -v 1.6.6

**Other deps**
* yum install mariadb
* yum install MariaDB-devel.x86_64
* yum install nodejs (not sure why)
