* Admin: graceful invalid-page handling
* Admin: redo crumbs to be an array?

* Puma

* tags
  - cuke tests
  - admin interface
  - tag deletion effects (delete post / delete tag)

* form hint support

* add form hints
  - Nice Url
  - headline

* user change password

* email password reset

* post.user_id should be nullable, in case of deleted user
  (should be non-null on post-creation though)

* change redcarpet render usage to be like this:
  http://icelab.com.au/articles/render-single-line-markdown-text-with-redcarpet/

* Maybe do something about /home/blog/legacy_files.  Maybe.
